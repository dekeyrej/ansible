# Sample ansible playbook demonstrating some functionality in Proxmox-VE
# using the community.general.proxmox_kvm and proxmox_disk modules as
# encpsulated in the two roles included below.

# the first role creates a VM to be the template for the actual hosts to be provisioned
# -- note -- "import image to disk" requires root@pam credentials to import from an absolute path
# the second role makes a series of clones based on the info in 03_host_list.yaml
# -- note -- user@pve PVEAdmin level credentials are sufficient for this role
