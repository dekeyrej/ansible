# üìú Ansible Playbooks Overview

This directory contains the orchestration logic for provisioning and configuring the homelab infrastructure. Each playbook is scoped to a specific phase of the system lifecycle ‚Äî from VM creation and container setup to cluster deployment and service initialization.

For example, to provision, configure, deploy and support development my 'production' environment
```mermaid
graph LR
  A[00_proxmox] --> B[04_cluster]
  B --> C[10_magicmirror]
  B --> D[77_vscodeserver]
  B --> E[55_open-webui]
```

Variable files (`*.yaml`) are used to inject structured configuration into playbooks, keeping logic declarative and reusable.

## üì¶ Playbook Index

| Playbook | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `00_proxmox.yaml` | Provisions Proxmox VMs and containers, sets up Vault with TLS and auto-unseal. |
| `01_template_overrides.yaml` | Variable file for customizing VM templates. |
| `03_sha_keys.yaml` | Variable file containing SSH keys used for provisioning. |
| `04_cluster.yaml` | Builds a MicroK8s cluster with MicroCeph, configures Vault, and deploys microservices. |
| `05_disk_list.yaml` | Variable file defining disk layout for MicroCeph nodes. |
| `10_magicmirror.yaml` | Provisions a container and installs MagicMirror¬≤ with Node.js and PM2. |
| `55_open-webui.yaml` | Sets up an LXC container with GPU passthrough to run Open WebUI and Ollama. |
| `77_vscodeserver.yaml` | Provisions a container and installs VS Code Server dependencies, CLI tools, and Git config. |
| `88_proxmox_provision.yaml` | Draft playbook for unified Proxmox provisioning based on inventory `type=kvm` or `type=lxc`. |
| `manifest-sync-test.yaml` | Example of using `kubernetes-manifests-sync` with or without specifying `sync_keys` |
| `wait_for_hosts.yaml` | Utility playbook to pause execution until hosts are reachable post-reboot. |

## üß≠ Usage Notes

- Playbooks are designed to be run sequentially or selectively using tags.
- Variable files (`01`, `03`, `05`) are intended to be included via `vars_files` in other playbooks.
- Inventory metadata (e.g. `type=kvm`, `type=lxc`) is used to drive conditional logic in advanced provisioning.
- Most playbooks assume root or elevated privileges on target hosts.

---

## üß™ Future Enhancements

- Refactor `88_proxmox_provision.yaml` into a meta-role or collection for unified VM/container provisioning.
- Add tags to playbooks for selective execution (e.g. `--tags vault`, `--tags cluster`).
- Introduce playbook dependencies or orchestration via a master playbook or Makefile.
- Visualize playbook flow using Mermaid diagrams.
